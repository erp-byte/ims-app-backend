"""One mail identity for every IMS notification.

WHY
    Every sender set ``From`` to the bare address, so Gmail printed "erp" for a
    customer return, a job-work challan and an inward deletion alike. The sender
    column is fixed-width, always visible and first in the reading path, so it is
    the cheapest place to say which module is talking — and it was empty.

WHAT IT SETS
    From         "Candor · Job Work" <erp@candorfoods.in>   (same mailbox, just labelled)
    Subject      per policy, see below
    List-Id      jobwork.candorfoods.in — Gmail CAN filter this, via `list:`
    X-Candor-*   structured fields for Outlook rules / Gmail API / later tooling
    Auto-Submitted, X-Entity-Ref-ID — see "quiet wins" below

THE SUBJECT POLICY IS THE IMPORTANT PART
    Gmail groups a conversation by normalised subject *plus* References. Change the
    subject between two mails and the thread splits, even when the References chain
    is perfect — ERP's own sample_mail_service documents this the hard way.

    Customer returns and NPD sample requests deliberately thread today: one
    conversation per entity, with the action shown in the body banner. Putting a
    changing event in their subject would shatter those threads.

    So there are two policies:

      ANCHOR  threaded modules. The subject is left EXACTLY as it was, with at most
              a module glyph prefixed — and that glyph is constant per module, never
              per event, so the normalised subject never changes. Threading survives
              untouched, and the mail still carries a visual tag.

      EVENT   standalone mails (job work, inward deletion, daily report, security).
              Full grammar: "<glyph> <ID> — <what changed>". Each mail is its own
              inbox row, which is what these are.

    Nothing here touches Message-ID, In-Reply-To or References, and nothing touches
    mail bodies — the per-event banners and colours already in place keep working.

QUIET WINS
    Auto-Submitted: auto-generated  (RFC 3834) stops out-of-office auto-replies
    bouncing back into the ERP mailbox — a real source of noise on bulk sends.

    X-Entity-Ref-ID is a de-facto Gmail hint that keeps unrelated mails with similar
    subjects OUT of one another's threads. Applied to EVENT mails only, where each
    message is meant to stand alone (two job-work challans should never merge).
    Best-effort: Gmail does not document it, and it is inert everywhere else.
